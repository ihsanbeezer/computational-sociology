\section{COURSE DESCRIPTION}\label{course-description}}

This course is designed to introduce students to computational methods
and their applications to sociological research. We will discuss the
computational toolkit from the bottom up, beginning with the
fundamentals of programming and data analysis and management. Once these
fundamentals are in place, we will turn to different methods for
collecting data: application programming interfaces, web-scraping, and
online experiments. The remainder of the course will focus on
computational methods for data analysis. First, we will cover various
methods for the quantitative analysis of text data including word
embeddings, topic modeling, and supervised learning. Second, we will
discuss supervised machine learning in more depth, assessing the
relationship between prediction and explanation in social science,
discussing bias and other limitations of these methods, as well as the
opportunities these techniques present to work with images and
multimodal data. Finally, we will explore the role of simulation and
agent-based modeling in sociological research. Throughout the course
students will gain hands-on experience with these different techniques,
as well as an understanding of how these techniques are being used in
cutting-edge sociological research. Overall this course will provide
students with a strong conceptual foundation in computational sociology
and the ability to apply various techniques for data collection and
analysis in their own research. All assignments will be conducted using
the R programming language.

\hypertarget{prerequisites-and-preparation}{%
\section{PREREQUISITES AND
PREPARATION}\label{prerequisites-and-preparation}}

This course is designed for students without any experience using
computational methods or advanced statistics. Nonetheless, the course
will proceed more efficiently if students without any such experience
are willing to undertake some independent learning prior to the
beginning of the course. In particular, I recommend students familiarize
themselves with Github, the R programming language, the RStudio
computing environment, and RMarkdown documents, as we will be using
these tools throughout the course. We will review these topics over the
first few weeks of class, but the more familiar students are with these
tools, the more time we can spend focusing on their sociological
applications.

Chris Bail (a sociologist at Duke University) recently published a
series of video tutorials (\url{https://sicss.io/boot_camp}) and
exercises designed to introduce these tools. I highly recommend that
students watch these videos and review the relevant materials in \emph{R
for Data Science} (details on the book below) prior to the beginning of
the semester.

\hypertarget{assessment}{%
\section{ASSESSMENT}\label{assessment}}

There will be two types of assessment used in the course. There will be
several homework assignments throughout the semester that will be
designed to enable students to become familiar with the various
methodological techniques covered in the course. A tentative schedule of
these assignments can be found in the course outline below. Students
will also write an empirical paper over the course of the semester. The
paper will involve the collection of original data and preliminary
analyses using one or more of the approaches covered in the course. I
intend for the paper to be an opportunity for students to develop the
basis for a qualifying exam, master's thesis, or dissertation chapter.
Students are expected to make progress on the paper over the course of
the semester. At various points in the semester I will provide feedback
on the paper proposal, the methodology for data collection, and the data
analysis (see course outline for a timeline).

\hypertarget{readings}{%
\section{READINGS}\label{readings}}

There are weekly reading assignments for this course. These readings
include methodological texts, reviews of relevant methodological and
theoretical considerations, and examples of how sociologists and other
social scientists apply computational approaches in their research.
Given the complexity and unfamiliarity of some of the approaches we will
cover in the course, I have included a diverse set of readings for each
topic. Some students may find the technical readings more useful whereas
others may benefit from the more contextualized applications.

\section{COURSE POLICIES}\label{course-policies}}

The Rutgers Sociology Department strives to create an environment that
supports and affirms diversity in all manifestations, including race,
ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age, social class,
disability status, region/country of origin, and political orientation.
This class will be a space for tolerance, respect, and mutual dialogue.
Students must abide by the Code of Student Conduct at all times,
including during lectures and in participation online.

All students must abide by the university's Academic Integrity Policy.
Violations of academic integrity will result in disciplinary action.

In accordance with University policy, if you have a documented
disability and require accommodations to obtain equal access in this
course, please contact me during the first week of classes. Students
with disabilities must be registered with the Office of Student
Disability Services and must provide verification of their eligibility
for such accommodations.

I will also be making additional accommodations due to the COVID-19
pandemic. If you or your family are affected in any way that impedes
your ability to participate in this course, please contact me as soon as
you can so that we can make necessary arrangements.
